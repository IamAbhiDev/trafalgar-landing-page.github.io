# Trafalgar Landing Page

![Landing Page Screenshot](./screenshots/screenshot.png)

This repository contains the code for a simple HTML and CSS landing page. I built this project as a practice exercise to gain hands-on experience with Figma UI design files. The responsive design was not provided in the Design file, so as a result, the landing page isn't responsive. Feel free to explore and contribute to it.

## Demo

You can view a live demo of the landing page [here](https://iamabhidev.github.io/trafalgar-landing-page.github.io "Demo").

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project, you can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IamAbhiDev/trafalgar-landing-page.github.io.git
```

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
2. Customize the content, styles, and images to fit your specific needs.
3. Add additional sections or modify the existing ones as required.

Feel free to explore the project files and make any necessary modifications to suit your project requirements.
